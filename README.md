# rive_tutorial

A new Flutter application.

## Links to Tutorials I'm Following:

- [YouTube: Creating your own Custom Implicit Animations] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KiPEqzJIKQ)
- [YouTube: Flutter + Rive Emotions Animation Tutorial Part] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vVAYYSRbD2JRbfgj7CrDTWmNkynmm9y)

# I followed along with the Rive tutorial first. The next things I want to do:

- Add in the tween builder so that I can gradually shift the color transition between emotions
- Refactor this so to a Provider set up
- Fix all the if/else statements so it's a list of functions for each animation
